<h2>How long has Taylored Media been in business?</h2>

<p>Taylored Media has been building and maintaining

   websites since 2002, so roughly 14 years!</p>



<h2>What is the process for having a website built?</h2>

<p>Since each company is different, each approach and solution is different as well.

   Should you decide to have us create your site (and we hope you do!),

   the first step is to learn more about you and your company. This usually begins with

   a phone call to one of our representatives. We assess your wants and needs, and from

   that point, the design process begins.</p>

<p>Following your initial conversation, we conduct a needs analysis, where essentially, we

   figure out what the site needs to be, what it contains, etc. In the case you already

   have a site, the needs analysis serves as a tool to find improvements to your existing

   site.</p>

<p>We next work with focus groups and perform tests such as card sorts in order to see

   how your average customer would choose to navigate your site. During the card sort,

   the focus group members are handed note cards with specific tasks written on them

   pertaining to your site. They then sort the cards into groups and then name those groups,

   which is how the different categories for your site are determined. To ensure consistency and

   authenticity, this process is repeated numerous times and we do not influence the focus

   groups in any way.</p>

<p>Once the different categories have been determined, various models and prototypes of the site

   are created, each one evolving and increasing in detail more than the next. First, an

   abstract model is created. The abstract model shows the most basic of structures for your

   site. It is essentially a map of the different pages contained within the site. Once the

   abstract model is agreed upon, a low-fidelity prototype is created based on the abstract

   model. This prototype is essentially a "sketch" of how the site will look. Next the

   medium-fidelity prototype is created, which is a basic wire-framing of the site. It is a

   basic model of how the pages and components in the site are placed and interact with

   eachother. The final prototype is known as the high-fidelity prototype. This normally

   consists of a PhotoShop file that represents how the website will literally look on the

   internet, complete with all styling of components as well as various imagery.</p>

<p>Once everything is agreed upon, the site is then coded and launched to the specifications,

   and by golly you have a website of your very own!</p>



<h2>What are the costs associated with building a website?</h2>

<p>This is a difficult question to answer, as each site that we create is built with the

   specific needs of the customer in mind. The answer becomes more clear as the process

   moves along. Please contact one of our representatives to learn more about our pricing

   options.</p>



<h2>Will my site work on mobile devices?</h2>

<p>At Taylored Media, we take a mobile-fist approach to designing a web site,

   so the answer is yes.</p>



<h2>How will my site improve my business?</h2>

<p>It has been proven time and time again that having a website will increase business many

times over. This is because a website has the power to reach anyone in the entire world that

has a computer with the internet. Your business will effectively multiply it's customer base

exponentially by having a website.</p>



<h2>Our business already has a website. Would you be willing to work with what we already have?</h2>

<p>Taylored Media would be more than happy take your existing site and bring it up to today's

technological standards.</p>



<h2>Would someone be able to easily find my site through a search engine?</h2>

<p>Taylored Media utilizes search engine optimization on all of the sites we work on in order

   to give you the highest search rankings possible.</p>
